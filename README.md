like a scale, but better


Before, for my media player, I used the scale widget. 
This python script uses the Canvas of tkinter, with rectangles, for the different parts of the scale. It has several advantages, like being able to set the colors of parts of the scale, or displaying buffer.
This is very basic, lacking some functionality of the tkinter scale, but  of course it can be elaborated on.
